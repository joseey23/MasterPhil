This is a photoblog in development using React js and Mongo DB. 
Currently using REST API to communicate requests to the system and the server.
The system is based on the MERN stack architecture as it allows you to easily construct a three-tier architecture (front end, back end, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.
